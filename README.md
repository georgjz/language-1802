# 1802 Assembly Language Support in Atom
Adds language support for [RCA 1802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_1802) assembly to the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io).

Opcodes exclusive to the 1805 have yet to be added.

## Supported toolchains, assemblers, linkers, etc.

This package includes syntax highlighting for assembler directives, labels, etc. for the following toolchains:

Toolchain | Link | 1802 | 1805 | Platforms
----------|------|------|------|-----------
a18 | http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/a18.html | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Linux, Windows

I'm happy to add more assemblers as requested. Please use Github's issue function to report bugs or improvement ideas. Contributions are greatly appreciated!
